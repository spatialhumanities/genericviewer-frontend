# How to build your own Pundit bookmarklet 


## Requirements

* A bookmarklet, to be correctly loaded, requires an absolute URL to load 
itself from. Be sure to have some publicly available space on the web.

* You will need dojo's SDK package, version 1.6.x (tested with 1.6.1,
available at http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.6.1/), the file
name is dojo-release-1.6.1-src.tar.gz . By default the script looks for 
them in a directory called dojo_sdk_1.6.1, at the same level of Pundit's
/src directory. This name is configurable, as explained in a moment.

* You will need to patch these sources to enable the "withCredentials" 
xhr header. Let's say you extracted the .tar.gz inside the pundit tree,
to patch it enter the directory and use patch :
 # cd dojo-release-1.6.1-src
 # patch dojo/_base/xhr.js < ../bookmarklet_build/dojo_161.patch 

* The bookmarklet will need a bootstrap file, we usually call it
InitBookmarklet.js. It will also need an .html file which has the
required javascript to drag the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar.
Both these files will be automatically created by default in
/src/InitBookmarklet.js and /examples/bookmarklet.html (from Pundit
sources base directory).


##Â Configure the bookmarklet

* In order to build the bookmarklet, you will need to configure the script
build_bookmarklet.sh, customizing the variables sdk (path to the afore
mentioned SDK package), ver (the name you want to give to the bookmarklet)
and bmpath (the absolute URL to load the bookmarklet from)
 
* To configure the bookmarklet run-time, you must modify and customize the
punditConfig variable you can find in InitBookmarklet.js-template. For a
complete list of configuration options, see the Pundit documentation.


## Build the bookmarklet

Just launch ./build_bookmarklet.sh !
